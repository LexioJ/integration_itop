## [1.4.2] - 2026-08-11

### 🔧 Compatibility Fixes

### Fixed
- **Deprecated Exception in Notifier** (#6): `Notifier::prepare()` now throws `OCP\Notification\UnknownNotificationException` instead of the deprecated plain `InvalidArgumentException` when a notification is not known to this notifier — Nextcloud ≥ 30 logged a deprecation warning on every notifications API poll (e.g. from mobile clients or Unified Push) whenever other apps' notifications were processed
- **CI Links Missing Object ID**: Smart picker and search results for Configuration Items produced iTop URLs with an empty `id=` parameter (only UserRequest links worked) — CI queries use `output_fields=*`, which does not include the object id in iTop REST responses; the id is now taken from the response's `key` property in both the CI search and the preview mapper, so inserted links and previews point to the actual object
- **Localized iTop Date Formats**: iTop installations with a customized `date_and_time_format` (e.g. `d.m.Y`) delivered localized date strings via the REST API, causing "Invalid Date" in the dashboard widgets, wrong ticket sorting, and broken SLA deadline calculations — all REST responses are now normalized to `Y-m-d H:i:s` regardless of the server's locale configuration (supports `.`, `/`, and `-` separators in day-first, month-first, and year-first order), and the widgets fall back to the raw string instead of rendering "Invalid Date" for unparseable values

## [1.4.1] - 2026-07-26

### 🔧 Nextcloud 34 Compatibility, Token Setup Guidance & Release Polish

This release restores compatibility with Nextcloud 34, adds in-app guidance for the iTop personal token prerequisites, and fixes several issues found during the pre-release review of v1.4.0.

### Added
- **iTop Configuration Hint (Admin Settings)**: New warning card explaining that agents need `personal_tokens_allowed_profiles` configured in iTop's Configuration File Editor before they can create personal tokens, including a ready-to-adapt `$MyModuleSettings` example
- **Personal Token Help (Personal Settings)**: Info hint shown when the "Personal Tokens" option is missing from the user's iTop account, pointing them to their iTop administrator

### Fixed
- **Nextcloud 34 Compatibility**: Replaced removed legacy `\OC::$server->getURLGenerator()` / `getDatabaseConnection()` calls with the modern `\OCP\Server::get()` API — the deprecated shortcut methods were removed in Nextcloud 34, causing the admin and personal settings pages to abort mid-render with an Internal Server Error; also raised the supported max-version to 34
- **Broken Admin Settings CSS**: Removed a stray unclosed `.ticket-type-options` rule that swallowed the new config-hint styles and duplicated an existing selector
- **Template Translation Mismatch**: Removed embedded HTML from translatable strings in admin and personal settings templates so they match the locale catalogs (German translations now resolve correctly), and fixed a missing `%s` substitution that displayed literally instead of the instance name
- **Locale File Consistency**: Synced 5 new strings from .js locale files into the .json catalogs for en, de, and de_DE (server-side rendering reads .json — the strings would otherwise fall back to English)
- **Slow Custom CI Class Discovery**: The `ci-class-available` endpoint re-crawled the entire iTop datamodel (one HTTP request per module directory and XML file) on every call — the parsed class-definition map and a negative cache for undiscoverable icons are now persisted in appdata with a 24h TTL, reducing repeat loads from ~37s to under a second
- **Class Browser Not Updating**: Newly added custom CI classes now disappear from the selection panel immediately after saving instead of remaining listed
- **Debug Leftover**: Removed a stray `console.log` from the dashboard widget and rebuilt the frontend bundle

- **Software Search Field Name**: Corrected OQL field `vendor_name` to `vendor` matching the iTop data model
- **Personal Settings CI Icons**: Custom CI classes now display correct icons instead of falling back to the notification bell icon
- **Missing Translations**: Added 54 v1.4.0 translatable strings (ticket system detection, custom CI classes, newsroom mirroring, icon management) to all locale files (en, de, de_DE, fr)
- **Translation Coverage**: Added 15 remaining strings with proper German Informal (Du-form) and German Formal (Sie-form) translations to de and de_DE, and 14 strings to fr — all 4 locales now fully cover the English source strings
- **Locale File Consistency**: Normalized emoji encoding in en.json and fr.json, regenerated .js locale files from .json sources to ensure frontend translations stay in sync

## [1.3.0] - 2025-11-08

### ✨ Major New Feature: Agent Notifications System

Version 1.3.0 introduces a comprehensive notification system with **12 notification types** across two independent tracks: Portal (4 types) and Agent (8 types). The system provides smart, event-driven notifications with weekend-aware SLA warnings and zero duplicate detection.

### Added

#### Agent Notification System (8 Types)
- **Ticket Assignment Tracking**:
  - `ticket_assigned`: New tickets assigned to you from unassigned state
  - `ticket_reassigned`: Tickets reassigned to you from another agent
  - `team_unassigned_new`: New unassigned tickets appearing in your team's queue

- **SLA Management**:
  - `ticket_tto_warning`: Time To Own SLA warnings with escalating urgency (⏰ 24h → ⚠️ 12h → 🟠 4h → 🔴 1h)
  - `ticket_ttr_warning`: Time To Resolve SLA warnings with same escalation pattern
  - `ticket_sla_breach`: SLA deadline exceeded alerts (🚨 icon)
  - **Weekend-Aware Logic**: Friday uses 72h threshold, Saturday uses 48h threshold to catch Monday/Tuesday breaches

- **Priority & Comments**:
  - `ticket_priority_critical`: Automatic alerts when tickets escalate to critical priority (🔴 icon)
  - `ticket_comment`: New comments on your tickets (both public and private log types)

#### Portal Notification Enhancements

  - `ticket_status_changed`: Status transitions
  - `agent_responded`: Public comments from agents
  - `ticket_resolved`: Resolution notifications
  - `agent_assigned`: Agent assignment changes

#### Background Job Infrastructure
- **CheckAgentTicketUpdates**: New background job running every 5 minutes
  - Processes all 8 agent notification types
  - Portal-only filtering (skips users with `is_portal_only='1'`)
  - Per-user interval checking (5-1440 minutes configurable)
  - Query optimization (skips API calls when notification types disabled)
  - Rate limiting (max 20 notifications per user per run)

- **CheckPortalTicketUpdates**: Existing job (enhanced)
  - Improved query optimization
  - Better timestamp handling
  - Contact role filtering support

#### Admin Configuration
- **3-State Notification Control**: Configure each notification type independently

- **Configurable Intervals**:
  - Admin default: 5-1440 minutes (recommended: 15 minutes)
  - Per-user override available in personal settings

#### OCC Commands
- **Enhanced `itop:notifications:test-user`**:
  - New `--agent` flag for testing agent notifications
  - New `--portal` flag for testing portal notifications (default)
  - `--reset` flag to clear timestamps and force full re-check
  - Displays user configuration, enabled notifications, and next execution time

#### API & Services
- **New ItopAPIService Methods**:
  - `getAgentTicketIds()`: Get tickets assigned to agent
  - `getTicketsApproachingDeadline()`: SLA warning detection with crossing-time algorithm
  - `getTeamAssignmentChanges()`: Detect new unassigned team tickets
  - `applyCrossingTimeAlgorithm()`: Weekend-aware threshold calculation (private)

- **Team Detection**:
  - Leverages existing `getUserTeams()` method

### Changed

#### Notification Algorithm Improvements
- **SLA Crossing-Time Algorithm**: Detects threshold crossings without storing per-ticket state
  - Eliminates duplicate warnings for same SLA level
  - Dynamically calculates when each threshold (24h/12h/4h/1h) will be crossed
  - Only notifies most urgent level if multiple thresholds crossed
  - Weekend expansion: Friday (72h), Saturday (48h) for 24h threshold

- **Notification Deduplication**:
  - Unique object keys: `ticket_id|subject|timestamp_hash`
  - Timestamp filtering prevents re-processing old changes
  - Leverages Nextcloud's native duplicate prevention

#### User Experience
- **Personal Settings UI**: Agent notifications section (only visible to non-portal users)
  - Master toggle for agent notifications
  - Granular per-type checkboxes (only "User Choice" types shown)

#### New User Preferences (oc_preferences)
- `notification_last_agent_check`: Unix timestamp of last agent notification check
- `disabled_agent_notifications`: JSON array of disabled notification types OR "all"
- `notification_check_interval`: Per-user custom interval (minutes)

#### Architecture Highlights
- **Dual Background Jobs**: Portal and Agent jobs run independently
- **CMDBChangeOp Detection**: Leverages iTop's built-in change tracking (no external state)
- **Minimal State Storage**: Only timestamps per user (no per-ticket data)
- **Query Optimization**: Early exit if all notifications disabled, selective API calls
- **Portal-Only Filtering**: Agent job automatically skips portal-only users

#### Performance
- **Per-User Intervals**: Users only processed when their interval elapses (reduces API load)
- **Query Optimization**: Up to 100% reduction in API calls when notification types disabled
- **Rate Limiting**: Max 20 notifications per user per run prevents spam
- **Smart Caching**: Team memberships cached for 30 minutes, agent names for 24 hours

#### Translation Updates
- Updated en.json, de.json, de_DE.json, fr.json with agent notification types

### Breaking Changes
None - Existing portal notifications continue working without changes.

### Migration Notes
- **No user action required**: Portal notifications work as before
